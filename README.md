A **high-accuracy gender classification model** trained on a custom dataset of **181K+ images** of male and female pictures.  
This project focuses on:
- Large-scale dataset management.
- Power outage recovery during training.
- Overfitting prevention with modern deep learning techniques.

## üõ°Ô∏è Power Outage Recovery

Implemented a **robust checkpointing system** to handle unexpected power loss:
- Saves **every epoch checkpoint** (model, optimizer, scheduler).
- Keeps **best accuracy model** separately.
- Auto-scans and resumes from highest-accuracy checkpoint.
- Preserves optimizer & scheduler state for continued training.

---

## üìâ Overfitting Prevention

Techniques applied:
- Weight Decay.
- Strong Data Augmentation.
- Learning Rate Scheduling.
- Freeze Backbone (first 5 epochs).
- Separate LR for backbone & head.

---

## üìù Experiment Tracking

- **MLflow** for logging metrics & parameters.
- **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Confusion Matrix** generated every 10 epochs.

---

## üß† Model Architecture
- Backbone: **EfficientNetV2-L**  
- Loss: Cross-Entropy Loss  
- Optimizer: AdamW with Weight Decay  
- Scheduler: Cosine Annealing LR  
- Validation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score
